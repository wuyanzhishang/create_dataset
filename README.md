# create_dataset
Create your own dataset similar to MNIST
If you have images and you want to create a dataset similar to mnist
I have created a function which will return a numpy array of 3 dimension
Example of MNIST:
  if you have 60,000 training images
  then the function will return (60000,28,28) numpy array
